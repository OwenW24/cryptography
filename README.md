# Understanding Cryptography

This repository contains my notes, projects, and problems solved while studying Christof Paar's [Understanding Cryptography textbook](www.cryptography-textbook.com) and [Introduction to Cryptography lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/@introductiontocryptography4223).  
The chapters will be sorted according to the topics covered in the lecture series.
